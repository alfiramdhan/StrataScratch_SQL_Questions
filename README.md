### ðŸ“Œ Amazon | Interview Questions | Order Details

Consider the Jill and Eva as first names of customers.
Output the order date, details and cost along with the first name.
Order records based on the customer id in ascending order.

```sql
SELECT a.first_name,
        b.order_date,
        b.order_details,
        b.total_order_cost
FROM customers a
JOIN orders b ON a.id = b.cust_id
WHERE a.first_name IN ('Jill', 'Eva')
ORDER BY b.cust_id ASC;
```

### ðŸ“Œ Amazon | Interview Questions | Customer Details
[Question: ](https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/9891-customer-details?code_type=1) Find the details of each customer regardless of whether the customer made an order. Output the customer's first name, last name, and the city along with the order details.
You may have duplicate rows in your results due to a customer ordering several of the same items. Sort records based on the customer's first name and the order details in ascending order.

```sql
SELECT a.first_name,
        a.last_name,
        a.city,
        b.order_details
FROM customers a
LEFT JOIN orders b ON a.id = b.cust_id
ORDER BY 1, 4 ASC;
```

### ðŸ“Œ Meta/Facebook | General Practice | Find all posts which were reacted to with a heart
[Question: ](https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/10087-find-all-posts-which-were-reacted-to-with-a-heart?code_type=1) Find all posts which were reacted to with a heart. For such posts output all columns from facebook_posts table.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT b.*
FROM facebook_reactions a
JOIN facebook_posts b ON a.post_id = b.post_id

```
In solution above, we need to add DISTINCT so that there is no data duplication

### ðŸ“Œ Meta/Facebook | Interview Questions | Popularity of Hack
[Question: ](https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/10061-popularity-of-hack?code_type=1) Meta/Facebook has developed a new programing language called Hack.To measure the popularity of Hack they ran a survey with their employees. The survey included data on previous programing familiarity as well as the number of years of experience, age, gender and most importantly satisfaction with Hack. Due to an error location data was not collected, but your supervisor demands a report showing average popularity of Hack by office location. Luckily the user IDs of employees completing the surveys were stored.

Based on the above, find the average popularity of the Hack per office location. Output the location along with the average popularity.

```sql
SELECT location,
        avg(popularity)as avg_popularity
FROM facebook_employees a
JOIN facebook_hack_survey b ON a.id = b.employee_id
GROUP BY 1;
```

### ðŸ“Œ Netflix | General Practice | Count the number of movies that Abigail Breslin nominated for oscar
