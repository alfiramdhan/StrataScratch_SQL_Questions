Consider the Jill and Eva as first names of customers.
Output the order date, details and cost along with the first name.
Order records based on the customer id in ascending order.

```sql
SELECT a.first_name,
        b.order_date,
        b.order_details,
        b.total_order_cost
FROM customers a
JOIN orders b ON a.id = b.cust_id

    SELECT user_id,
            DATE(timestamp)as date,
            
-- since we need lates page_load and earlist page_exit so we use MIN() and MAX() function
            MAX(CASE WHEN action = 'page_load' then timestamp end)as pg_load,
            MIN(CASE WHEN action = 'page_exit' then timestamp end)as pg_exit
    FROM facebook_web_log

```

### ðŸ“Œ Meta/Facebook | Interview Questions | Highest Energy Consumption
[Question: ](https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/10064-highest-energy-consumption?code_type=1) Find the date with the highest total energy consumption from the Meta/Facebook data centers. Output the date along with the total energy consumption across all data centers.

Hint :
- Use UNION ALLs to combine all data in a list so that you don't lose any data
- Use the SUM() function to find the total energy consumption by date
- Find the max total energy consumption independent of date

```sql
WITH CTE AS(
    SELECT *
    FROM fb_eu_energy
    UNION ALL
    SELECT *
    FROM fb_asia_energy
    UNION ALL
    SELECT *
    FROM fb_na_energy

    SELECT date,
            SUM(consumption)as total_consumption
    FROM CTE
    GROUP BY 1
    ORDER BY 2 DESC
)
    SELECT *
    FROM CTE_2

                                FROM CTE_2);
```

### ðŸ“Œ Meta/Facebook | Interview Questions | Acceptance Rate By Date
[Question: ](https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/10285-acceptance-rate-by-date?code_type=1) What is the overall friend acceptance rate by date? Your output should have the rate of acceptances by the date the request was sent. Order by the earliest date to latest.

Assume that each friend request starts by a user sending (i.e., user_id_sender) a friend request to another user (i.e., user_id_receiver) that's logged in the table with action = 'sent'. If the request is accepted, the table logs action = 'accepted'. If the request is not accepted, no record of action = 'accepted' is logged.

```sql
WITH CTE AS(
    SELECT date,
            action,
            LEAD(action) OVER(PARTITION BY user_id_sender, user_id_receiver ORDER BY date)AS done
    FROM fb_friend_requests
)
    SELECT date,
            COUNT(done)::numeric /count(action) as acceptance_rate
    FROM CTE        
    WHERE action = 'sent'
    GROUP BY 1;

            group_name,
            song_name
    FROM billboard_top_100_year_end
    WHERE year in ('2010')
)
    SELECT DISTINCT the_rank,
            group_name,
            song_name
    FROM CTE
    WHERE the_rank <= 10
    ORDER BY 1;

## Difficulty : Hard

### ðŸ“Œ Airbnb | Interview Questions | Host Popularity Rental Prices
[Question: ](https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/9632-host-popularity-rental-prices?code_type=1) Youâ€™re given a table of rental property searches by users. The table consists of search results and outputs host information for searchers. Find the minimum, average, maximum rental prices for each hostâ€™s popularity rating. The hostâ€™s popularity rating is defined as below:
0 reviews: New
1 to 5 reviews: Rising
6 to 15 reviews: Trending Up
16 to 40 reviews: Popular
more than 40 reviews: Hot

Tip: The id column in the table refers to the search ID. You'll need to create your own host_id by concating price, room_type, host_since, zipcode, and number_of_reviews.

Output host popularity rating and their minimum, average and maximum rental prices.

Hint :
- Youâ€™ll need to create a few where each host (USING CONCAT() function) is listed only once. So taking the average, min, max without de-duplicating would skew the results.
- Using the new view of distinct hosts, categorize the hosts by their popularity rating defined by their number of reviews.
- Find the average, min, max price by popularity rating

```SQL
SELECT host_pop_rating,
        MIN(price)as minimum_rental,
        AVG(price)as average_rental,
        MAX(price)as maximum_rental
FROM (
    SELECT CONCAT(price, host_since, zipcode, number_of_reviews)as host_id,
            CASE WHEN number_of_reviews = 0 THEN 'New'
                WHEN number_of_reviews BETWEEN 1 AND 5 THEN 'Rising'
                WHEN number_of_reviews BETWEEN 6 AND 15 THEN 'Trending Up'
                WHEN number_of_reviews BETWEEN 16 AND 40 THEN 'Popular'
                WHEN number_of_reviews > 40 THEN 'Hot'
            END AS host_pop_rating,
            price
    FROM airbnb_host_searches
    GROUP BY 1,2,3)as cte
GROUP BY 1   
```

### ðŸ“Œ Amazon | Interview Questions | Marketing Campaign Success [Advanced]
[Question: ](https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/514-marketing-campaign-success-advanced?code_type=1) You have a table of in-app purchases by user. Users that make their first in-app purchase are placed in a marketing campaign where they see call-to-actions for more in-app purchases. Find the number of users that made additional in-app purchases due to the success of the marketing campaign.

The marketing campaign doesn't start until one day after the initial in-app purchase so users that only made one or multiple purchases on the first day do not count, nor do we count users that over time purchase only the products they purchased on the first day.
